> Internal Discord drawing, externally. (very external, you can even use a different device to draw to the target one)

### Proof of concept

![could not load the poc](/media/poc.gif?raw=true)

# Wait what?

After hooking the target process, Discord initializes an Electron window that loads a URL that looks something like this `https://discord.com/overlay?build_id=x&rpc=y&rpc_auth_token=z&pid=w`
<br>
It then copies the frame buffer from this window and draws it over the game's window.

By making Discord load a local hosted WebGL 2.0 renderer, we can communicate with it in order to draw over games and (potentially) get keyboard inputs.

# Setup

You can set up the overlay using two different methods:

- [Patching the executable.](#patching-the-executable)
- [Proxying the requests.](#proxying-the-requests)

## Patching the executable

Replace Discord's request URL with your loopback URL in the file `AppData\Local\Discord\app*\modules\discord_overlay2-1\discord_overlay2\host.js`

```javascript
function createRenderer(pid, url) {
  ...
  urlWithPid.searchParams.append('pid', pid.toString());
  url = urlWithPid.toString();
  // Begin page hijacking.
  url = "http://127.0.0.1:4001/";
  // End page hijacking.
  renderers[pid] = {
    pid: pid,
  ...
}
```

In the CSharp project there is a method that automatically patches Discord with the given IP address and port.
To unpatch it (and restore the original overlay) you only have to remove the `url = "xxx";` line from `host.js`.

## Proxying the requests

This is the recommended method because you are not touching Discord's files, and the result will be maintained, even after software updates.

# Build

You can build this project on either Windows or Linux.
<br>
The shared library build allows you to use it inside your existing projects. An example of how to use it this way is DiscoverSharp inside of the bindings folder.

### Prerequisites

- [GoLang](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MinGW-W64](https://netix.dl.sourceforge.net/project/mingw-w64/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/mingw-w64-install.exe) (Windows only)
- [Discord](https://golang.org/dl/) (only required on the guest machine)

### Compile

- Run `setup.sh`
- Run the build script for the output you desire.

# Usage

- Make sure Discord is closed and launch the program.
- Open Discord.
- Enable `GameOverlay` if it's not enabled yet.
- Launch any game and enjoy internal drawing.
